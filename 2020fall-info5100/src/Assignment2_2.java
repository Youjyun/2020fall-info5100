     * Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number)
     * which has the largest sum and outprint its sum.

     * Example 1:
     * Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
     * Output: 6
     * Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
     *
     * Example 2:
     * Input: nums = [1]
     * Output: 1
